## Styling convention
Throughout the process of making this app, i tried to adhere to the convention's outlined in [PEP 8 - style guide for python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as best as possible. utilising heavy use of <b> Snake_case </b> Which is a styling where the naming of things utilises an _ where their would be a space between the words.

The code is organized into logical sections and functions to improve readability and maintainability. The use of functions helps encapsulate specific tasks or operations.
