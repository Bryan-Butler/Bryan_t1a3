## Styling convention
Throughout the process of making this app, i tried to adhere to the convention's outlined in [PEP 8 - style guide for python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as best as possible. utilising heavy use of <b> Snake_case </b> Which is a styling where the naming of things utilises an _ where their would be a space between the words.

The code is organized into logical sections and functions to improve readability and maintainability. The use of functions helps encapsulate specific tasks or operations.

Commenting used fairly thoroughly throughout to indicate what code is doing what.
